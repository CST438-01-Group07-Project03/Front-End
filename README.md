## Overview

FoodSwipe lets users swipe through cards of foods and restaurants — swipe right to like, swipe left to pass. Liked items are saved to your profile. Other users can browse your liked list and vote on your choices.

## Features

- **Swipe Interface** — Tinder-style cards for foods and restaurants
- **Like / Pass** — Swipe right to save to your profile; swipe left to skip (recorded so it won't reappear)
- **Undo** — Undo a pass from your profile
- **User Profile** — View and manage all your liked foods and restaurants
- **Browse Users** — See other users' public profiles and what they've liked
- **Groups** — Create a group, invite others, and collaboratively vote on foods/restaurants
- **Admin Panel** — Manage users, foods, and restaurants; grant/revoke admin roles
